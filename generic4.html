							<h1>Unreal Engine 5 And Custom Editor Tools</h1>
					
							<p>Using C++, I have familiarised myself with and am continuing to learn about Unreal Engine 5 and custom editor tools.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic18.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I have used time outside of my course work and other learning to learn through multiple courses about C++ use of Unreal Engine Five, along with the creation of tools and utilities for it.<br />
							This currently includes the creation of quick asset actions accessed directly from the content browser menu, with their own icons and tooltips.<br />
							These utilities allow for actions such as the quick finding and deletion of unused assets and empty folders within a given folder.<br />
							Other scripted asset actions include automatic application of prefixes to assets, sorting into appropriate folders batch renaming or duplication and more.</p>
							
							<p>I have also created an in-editor custom slate widget which allows the user to display a list of all assets within a given folder and sort these according to options such as only unused assets, or assets which share the same name with at least one other.<br />
							The list displays asset  type, and through checkboxes allows the user to select and delete specific assets from the list.</p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic20.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> Shown here is a widget to allow fast and simple creation of materials from their component files.<br />
							It not only produces properly laid-out material nodes, but also supports channel packing to fill in multiple channels from a single file</p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic21.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Shown here is a widget for quick selection and alteration of multiple assets in the editor.<br />
							The user may select assets by similar names to a selected asset, or a searchphrase, and duplicate along with altering the rotation, offset and scale by a random amount within user-defined limits.</p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic22.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							Also shown is a level editor actor menu extension that allows the user to prevent selection of a given actor through use of an applied actor tag, interacting with and preventing any attempt to select the actor. This may then be removed with a neighbouring action.<br />
							This also interacts with the editor and improves its use through use of editor hotkeys, and integration into the world outliner, allowing easy display and toggling of the selection-lock status of all actors.</p>
							
							
							<p>As well as the expansion of current features, I am also learning about and creating further features.<br />
							This section is actively being developed and will continue to be updated.</p>
							
							<p>Made using C++, in Visual Studio 2022.</p>
