							<h1>Game Total-Conversion Project</h1>
					
							<p>Over the past couple of years, I pursued my interest outside my degree courses by working in a team leadership position on a large collaborative total-conversion game modification project of over 200 members and over a quarter of a million players.</p>
							
							<h2>Key features:</h2>

							<a id="intro-anchor">The Project:</a>
							
							<p>This project totally converts the WW2 grand strategy of Hearts of Iron 4 into a both strategic and narrative cold war simulation game.<br />
							The mod faced a successful release and in a Paradox Interactive Dev-Diary less than a year after release, was marked as the third largest total conversion mod for the game.<br />
							The project overhauls numerous game features, including the creation of a new global economic system more suitable to a cold war simulation.<br />
							Other features include but are not limited to a total visual overhaul, custom original soundtrack and experimental usage of game features.<br />
							These all combine to change the atmosphere, gameplay and objectives of the game to create a new, unique experience which has continued to expand and improve.</p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic23.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							
							<a id="management-anchor">Project Management:</a>
							
							<p>My work in the team has involved both the design and implementation of content, as a member of sub-teams and in leadership of such teams.<br />
							Through this I developed my problem-solving and communication skills by coordinating with members of different roles to collaborate and produce a high-quality finished product.</p>
							
							<p> My work and interaction within the team varied much over time. This included the expansion of standard game-features for new content, to developing new gameplay mechanics and finding creative ways to repurpose vanilla features to solve problems.<br />
							It also gave me much practice in both the visual and practical design of GUIs. Through close communication with our QA team, I was able to review and improve upon our designs.<br />
							Developing in varied positions helped to understand the workflow of other team members to better cooperate with them.</p>
							
							<p>Alongside some degree of involvement in most upcoming content updates, I was responsible for management of the teams completion and release of the long-developed 1.3 update, involving much GUI development, new mechanics and improvement of existing content<br />
							I was also in charge of a major overhaul to the tech system within this update, along with overhauls in previous updates integrating new game features and adapting them to better suit the custom tech system.<br />
							In these overhauls I managed the expansion of our tech team to meet rising demand for mod-stylised GFX, as the number of custom GUIs expanded in these and future updates.</p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic25.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							
							<a id="design-anchor">Project Management:</a>
							
							<p>I was also thoroughly involved in the production of the 1.4 update, "Silicon Dreams", in which I was able to further experiment with testing new mechanics to change the way in which the game is played.<br />
							These mechanics, including the implementation of special objectives within combat to change the ordinarily repetitious base-game gameplay loop, were well received and may help to guide design of future content.<br />
							This update also saw the first significant use of custom shader code within interfaces for depicting regions. This has shown incredible use for replacing previous labour-intensive methods involving production of numerous image frames.</p>
							
							<p>My time in this project has helped enable me to practice project management and time management, organization of research, planning and general documentation for code and graphical assets.<br />
							I also learnt the importance of proper documentation, especially in a volunteer project where there is inevitably a high turnover rate of members who will need to familiarize themselves with existing planning and code.</p>
