							<p>Through this project, I have familiarised myself with Unreal Engine and practised using C++ for game development.<br />
							This involved the design, development and iteration of numerous game mechanics, made for ease of use by game/level designers within the editor.</p>
							
							<p>Some key features of my UE5 development:</p>

							<h3 id="interaction-main-anchor">Key Features:</h3>
							
							<p>The interaction system allows for a player to observe, interact with and manipulate their environment using both their default camera view and a cursor.<br />
							This considers player input relative to where the object is held in 3D space, making for more immersive handling of doors, valves and more.</p>
							
							<h3 id="interaction-basic-anchor">General Interaction:</h3>
							
							<p>Object interaction is built around a family of components that contain all needed interaction logic, for simple use by non-coders within the editor.<br />
							When an object falls under the reticule/cursor, it is highlighted for interaction, until a new object is found or the player looks away for long enough.<br />
							Objects may be "observed" to receive information, or interacted to carry out the logic of its interaction component.</p>
							
							<p>This may be applied to anything from general scenery with observation messages, to moving parts like buttons on machinery.</p>
							
							
							<h3 id="interaction-drag-anchor">Manipulating Moving Actors:</h3>
							
							<iframe width="700" height="445"
								src="images/DraggingLockerDraw.gif">
							</iframe>
							
							<p>The system may be used to manipulate actors in the game world, gripping the object by a point in 3D space and translating mouse movement into a vector relative to this point, by which to apply force.<br />
							This works for both angular and direct movement, lending itself to all variety of objects from carefully opening doors to searching drawers.</p>
							
							
							<h3 id="interaction-valve-anchor">Accurate Valve Movement:</h3>
							
							<iframe width="723" height="463"
								src="images/newvalve.gif">
							</iframe>
							
							<p>The system also supports axel-based rotation for objects such as valves.<br />
							This is achieved by generating a vector tangential to the valve from the holding point, to tell if force is clockwise or anticlockwise.</p>
							
							<h3 id="interaction-carry-anchor">Carrying and Placing Actors:</h3>
							
							<p>Objects may be picked up, moved and precisely placed through the interaction system.<br />
							The player can store objects in a "passive" position to free the cursor for manipulating the environment.<br />
							Both the reticule and cursor can be used to precisely place objects.</p>

							<h3 id="terminal-main-anchor">Key Features:</h3>
							
							<p>The terminal system allows the player to interact with a 3D terminal in the game-world to affect their environment.<br />
							This may be controlled through their own key inputs or a 3D keyboard in-game, using the cursor.</p>
							
							<p>The system is able to find the exact incorrect parameter to report, if an entered command is invalid.<br />
							Otherwise, the command and its constituent parameters may be passed along for affecting the game-world.</p>
							
							<p>The terminal may also use direction keys to traverse through the current line, or to recall previously entered commands.</p>
							
							<p>To explain terminal functions, an interactive manual with moving 3D pages has been created, using the interaction system.</p>

							<h3 id="AI-main-anchor">Key Features:</h3>
							
							<p>Much work has gone into allowing an AI-controlled character to meaningfully interact with the environment.
							This has posed numerous challenges of how it should interact with objects designed for the player interaction system, and of general performance.</p>
							
							<h3 id="AI-door-anchor">AI-Door Interaction:</h3>
							
							<p>To achieve AI-interaction with doors designed for the player interaction system, a larger setup was built around the door using navmesh modifiers and linkers.</p>
							
							<p>These were then connected to the interaction component of the door with delegates, to alter the navmesh elements as the door moves.<br />
							Whilst an open door provides a clear passage in the navmesh, a sufficiently closed door will instead prompt a smart navlink event through which the AI throws the door open before passing.</p>
							
							<p>This has proven sufficient in testing, after the addition of a collision volume to detect and knock the player away from a swung-open door, to avoid awkward physics interactions.<br />
							Through this, doors become an active element of player-AI interactions, closable as an obstacle and speedbump to a pursuing character.</p>
							
							<h3 id="AI-obstacle-anchor">Dynamic Obstacle-Navmesh Effects:</h3>
							
							<p>Further expanding on the player affecting AI behaviour, a combination of Navigation Query Filters and NavAreas affect how the AI navigates obstacles.</p>
							
							<p>An obstacle may change its NavArea from that of an untouched obstacle, to a tampered one and then as it is fully cleared become default navmesh.<br />
							The AI may likewise use different Navigation Query Filters based on its current state, with rising disregard for obstacles.</p>
							
							<p>Thus, a roaming AI will not touch untouched obstacles, and will at least try to find other ways past partial obstructions.<br />
							However, an AI searching for the source of a noise may happily break through an already damaged barrier in search of its tamperer.<br />
							An AI in pursuit of the player will break through any obstacle in their path.</p>
							
							<h3 id="AI-search-anchor">Environment Query System Usage:</h3>
							
							<p>The Environment Query System has been used to improve the the AI's ability to search their environment.</p>
							
							<p>If the AI has moved to investigate a sound and found no player, EQS is used to detect reachable locations that are currently not visible to the AI's sight.<br />
							This query is run in a forward facing cone, though if insufficient results are returned, the AI may turn to consider other search directions.</p>
							
							<p>Additionally, the AI Sight Target Interface has been improved for the player character, which by default only checks against the center of the player capsule.</p>

							<h3 id="level-main-anchor">Key Features:</h3>
							
							<p>As I began creating a proper level in which to use everything I've made, I began finding the need to streamline processes like setting up particle effects or adjusting stair meshes.<br />							
							I created some tools to help greatly speed up these tasks, whilst also being intuitive for others to use.</p>
							
							<h3 id="level-fog-anchor">Area Particle Effect Tools:</h3>
							
							<p>To rapidly set up fog effects throughout the level, I made a tool to easily adjust the parameters of a niagara system without delving into blueprints.<br />	
							Volumes could be used to visually determine the area-of-effect within the editor, and then apply these volume bounds to the particle system without any trial and error process.</p>
							
							<h3 id="level-stair-anchor">Instanced Mesh Stair Generation:</h3>
							
							<p>As I found issues with typical methods for creating and adjusting stair meshes in my level, I created a tool to generate and adjust stairs made from an instanced static mesh.<br />							
							From this, step increments and positions can be easily adjusted to fill any gap. A ramp collision automatically fits the stairs, to provide smoother player collisions for movement.</p>

							<h3 id="dither-main-anchor">Key Features:</h3>
							
							<p>This rendering approach was developed to emulate older games, whilst retaining the ability to dynamically increase the quality of select objects or surfaces.<br />
							This is done through a combination of downsampling, colour quantisation and dithering, using custom stencil information to dynamically change properties.</p>
							
							<p>The custom stencil value informs the shader how to manage the downsampling and the number of possible colour values from quantisation.<br />
							This allows for objects such as those locked in for interaction to become "in-focus" visually.<br />
							It also, importantly, allows for surfaces like book pages or a text-based terminal screen to remain legible whilst still matching their surroundings through a less constrained quantisation.</p>
