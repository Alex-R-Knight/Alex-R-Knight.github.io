							<h2 id="foundation-anchor">Initial Foundations:</h2>
							
							<iframe width="600" height="340"
								src="images/objecthighlightgif.gif">
							</iframe>
							
							<p>My first steps to developing the interaction system were to create a  component attached to the player camera to handle player-side logic.<br />
							This uses raycasts to find actors being looked at by the player, and check if an actor contains an interactor component or child of its class.<br />
							The interactor component family would make strong use of polymorphism to handle all interaction logic for objects.</p>
							
							<p>The currently selected object receives a highlight effect. Selection changes when another object it looked at, or the player looks away.<br />
							For convenience, the time to deselect from looking away is adjustable, this sort of coyote time approach helps make small objects less fiddly.</p>
							
							<p>The first interactor component child class sent a message to the player when used.<br />
							For this, I added a way to add message widgets to the screen, given message text and the time to display.<br />
							To stop multiple messages overlapping, the current widget instance is tracked and replaced if a new one is sent.</p>
							
							<p>At this point I experimented with features like holding and rotating interactive objects.<br />
							The feature at large didnt last, but it was the first use of the cursor, which was expanded on.</p>
							
							<h2 id="cursor-anchor">Mouse/Cursor Interaction:</h2>
							
							<iframe width="600" height="340"
								src="images/cursoricons.gif">
							</iframe>
							
							<p>The next step was to let the player toggle between normal mouse control, and using a cursor whilst still able to move around.</p>
							
							<p>In place of toggling the real mouse cursor’s visibility, a widget is used.<br />
							This was done so that I could expand this to add features such as context-sensitive changing of the cursor icon more easily.<br />
							The cursor is toggled by holding a key. Its position on the screen is used to fire rays, instead of where the camera looks directly.</p>
							
							<p>Once the cursor mode was set up, I added dynamic cursor icon changing based on the type of interactable object selected.<br />
							I did this by adding a function to the interactor component, so each child class could set a suitable cursor icon.</p>
							
							<p>Finally, to allow for camera rotation in cursor mode, I added a check that would apply rotation if the cursor was sufficiently close to any edge of the screen.</p>
							
							<h2 id="dragging1-anchor">First Implementation of Object Dragging:</h2>
							
							<iframe width="342" height="200"
								src="images/dragging.gif">
							</iframe>
							
							<p>The key feature request after the implementation of a cursor mode was the ability to drag objects, such as draws and hinged doors.<br />
							This feature would be heavily iterated upon.</p>
							
							<p>A parent draggable interactor class was made to hold the dragging logic shared between all draggable objects.<br />
							Specific child classes would handle different types of movement, such as hinged doors compared to draws.<br />
							Dragging is initiated by holding the interact button on a selected draggable object.<br />
							I used Unreal Engine’s Enhanced Input Action Mapping, which allowed for easy discerning between a tap or hold of the same key for different purposes.</p>
							
							<h4>Code - Dragger Input Handling:</h4>
							
							<p>The interactor would receive a vector from the player's mouse movement, and use a dot product to compare this vector against its object’s direction vector.<br />
							The more the two vectors align, the more the interactor will move forwards or backwards between its end-points of movement.<br />
							In this version, the input vector came purely from mouse movement. The vector was produced using the player camera’s up and right vectors multiplied by mouse input values.</p>
							
							<p>This produced a problem, if the player’s view aligned enough with the object direction vector, input could only be given in directions that would not induce movement.<br />
							To solve this, a second input vector was made that turned mouse up/down movement into the forwards/backwards direction.<br />
							These two input vectors were mixed based on a dot product of the player camera forward vector and the draggable object direction vector.<br />
							Hence, the more the player view and direction vector align, the more the alternate vector is used for drag-input instead, solving the problem.</p>
							
<pre>
<code class="cpp-html">
const FVector& InteractorRightVector = PlayerInteractor->GetRightVector();
const FVector& InteractorUpVector = PlayerInteractor->GetUpVector();
const FVector& InteractorForwardVector = PlayerInteractor->GetForwardVector();
const FVector& ActorForwardVector = GetOwner()->GetActorForwardVector();

FVector InputVector = ( InVector.X * InteractorRightVector ) - ( InVector.Y * InteractorUpVector );

const FVector AlternateInputVector = ( InVector.X * InteractorRightVector ) - ( InVector.Y * InteractorForwardVector );

const float MixValue = fabs( FVector::DotProduct(InteractorForwardVector, ActorForwardVector) );

InputVector = FMath::Lerp( InputVector, AlternateInputVector, MixValue );

float InputAlignment = FVector::DotProduct(InputVector, ActorForwardVector);
const float Scalar = (CursorMode) ? DragCursorMultiplier : DragMouseMultiplier;
InputAlignment = InputAlignment * MovementScale * Scalar;
</code>
</pre>
							<p>AlternateInputVector here is the alternate mapping of mouse movement to 3D direction for when the player and movement vector greatly align.<br />
							CursorMode indicates whether the player is using their cursor, in which case a different scalar is applied.</p>
							
							<p>This first implementation was a milestone in progress, but also highlighted several problems such as the current highlighting method showing through other surfaces, but also the way in which cursor movemed separately from the object being dragged.<br />
							Furthermore, there was a lack of momentum within dragged objects if they were released mid-movement.</p>
							
							
							<h2 id="dragging2-anchor">Object Dragging – Momentum:</h2>
							
							<iframe width="600" height="340"
								src="images/momentum.gif">
							</iframe>
							
							<p>To create the impression of momentum in dragged objects, I made the draggable interactor class record its last change in progress.<br />
							If dragging ceases, it instead moves itself using this recorded value, which will decrease towards zero over time based on a given deceleration rate.<br />
							The first version of this had issues due to this value only updating when input was received, causing occasional jump starts when released.<br />
							Hence, a check was added to remove this momentum value if the object became stationary whilst being dragged.</p>
							
							<h2 id="highlight1-anchor">Object Highlight Improvements:</h2>
							
							<p>The initial object highlight method was functional but found unsuitable due to it highlighting behind other geometry.<br />
							This method uses UE5’s custom depth buffer, in which only highlightable objects have rendering their custom depth enabled.<br />
							The buffer is then used for a simple edge detection method comparing the presence or lack thereof of custom depth buffer values.</p>
							
							<p>To improve this, the custom depth buffer is compared with the standard depth buffer, ignoring occluded parts of the object.<br />
							This has proven successful, and laid the foundations for further improvements.</p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/outlines.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							
							<h2 id="dragging3-anchor">Object Dragging Input Expansion:</h2>
							
							<p>Whilst mouse input could be used decently to control dragging, I wanted to factor in player movement whilst dragging objects.<br />
							Hence, player movement would also send input vectors to the draggable interactor.<br />
							This along with all other input would be multiplied by values changeable within the editor for easy adjustment of sensitivity.<br />
							These could also tweak drag input/player movement speed depending on both the cursor mode and if dragging was underway.</p>
							
							<h2 id="cursor2-anchor">Mouse Cursor Following Points in 3D Space:</h2>
							
							<p>To finally fix the disconnect between draggable object and mouse cursor movement, significant changes had to be made.<br />
							A second cursor widget was made purely for dragging objects. Whenever a draggable object is locked in for interaction, the last point of contact between the player and the object is saved.<br />
							This point's offset is saved, and moves with the actor, and is translated into screenspace to position the cursor widget.<br />
							When dragging is terminated, the same screen-space position is used to place the normal cursor widget in its place.</p>
							
							<iframe width="600" height="340"
								src="images/dragcursor.gif">

							<p></p>
							
							<h2 id="demo-anchor">First Demo Video:</h2>
							
							<p>A video was made at this stage, which also shows some other features such as the ability to inspect an area in order to interact with finer details.</p>
							
							<iframe width="1200" height="680"
								
								  <source src="images/DemoVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								
							</iframe>
							<p></p>
							
							<h2 id="dragging4-anchor">Further Improvement of Draggable Object Movement:</h2>
							
							<p>To create smoother and more "weighty" handling of draggable objects, I tested a new way of handling object movement.<br />
							Previously object momentum only applied after the player had released the object. It would now be the sole driving force moving the object.<br />
							The player contributes to it via input, and the momentum naturally moves towards zero.</p>
							
							<p>Whilst adding this new method, I also improved on a previous design choice, by moving all input multipliers from the player character to the draggable object, allowing me to fine tune individual objects to handle differently.<br />
							This, after the tweaking of some parameters, produced smoother and overall better object movement.</p>
							
							<iframe width="800" height="600"
								src="images/improvedswinggif.gif">
							</iframe>
							<p></p>
							
							<p>I reenabled player rotation from the cursor being close to the screen edge, this produced smoother movement and let the player follow a moving object better.<br />
							The rate of rotation was changed to increase the closer the cursor gets to the edge, creating smoother movement compared to the original "on/off" state of turning.</p>
							
							<iframe width="600" height="340"
								src="images/cursordrift.gif">
							</iframe>
							<p></p>
							
							<p>As I implemented my first UI elements, some minor problem solving was required, such as opting to terminate dragging and cursor mode when pausing, due to their shared use of the cursor with the pause screen.</p>
							
							<p>At this point, a brief demo was made to practise using the current features in an environment more resembling a game than a testing-room.<br />
							This was done using purpose-made assets, and gave good practise in using other parts of the engine.<br />
							It also helped to identify small issues or bugs, alongside needs like changing the capsule collision size for the player character to be suitable to a more cramped environment.</p>
							
							<iframe width="600" height="340"
								src="images/drawerdemogif.gif">
							</iframe>
							<p></p>
							
							<h2 id="dragging5-anchor">Object Carrying and Precision Placement:</h2>
							
							<iframe width="600" height="340"
								src="images/placementdemogif.gif">
							</iframe>
							<p></p>
							
							<p>A key feature request after the demo room was the ability to pick up and carry objects, in a way that did not disrupt other interaction mechanics.<br />
							For this, I used an editor-changeable offset for holding a carried object below the centre of the screen using a physics handle.<br />
							Interacting with a suitable object would toggle carrying it.<br />
							This worked, but putting the object down was limited to dropping it from its carrying position, typically dumping your object onto the floor.</p>
							
							<p>To solve this, I implemented a way of precisely positioning the object before releasing it.<br />
							If dragging is initiated on the object then the physics handle target is set by a raycast based on cursor screen position.<br />
							The point of ray impact then has an offset applied in the direction of the surface normal of the hit position.<br />
							This slightly floats the object above a surface until it is released, and reduces unwanted collisions when moving the object around sharp corners.</p>
							
							<p>Other edge cases involving a lack of ray collision were accounted for as well, to prevent any unwanted behaviour.<br />
							This solution has so far proven suitable, though I would like to explore any ways to further improve it.</p>
							
							
							<h2 id="breaker-anchor">Further Applications of Mechanics:</h2>
							
							<iframe width="600" height="340"
								src="images/keypadgif.gif">
							</iframe>
							
							<p>I wanted to build on my system so interaction components could be used as building blocks in interactive machines and puzzles.<br />
							The first step was to improve dragger components, to recognise when an object enters or exits its limits of movement.<br />
							I could use this for objects such as levers or breaker switches. I used C++ delegates to let these components communicate with the rest of the level.</p>
							
							<p>I tested this new functionality with a breaker switch, that toggled the power to a room's lighting and a keypad needed to unlock a door.<br />
							The keypad was made of interactive buttons and a widget component, to avoid unimmersive popup widgets filling the screen.
							
							
							<h2 id="wheel-anchor">Accurate 3D Valve-Interaction:</h2>
							
							<iframe width="600" height="508"
								src="images/valvegif.gif">
							</iframe>
							<p></p>
							
							<p>As I expanded on my interaction system, I noted the need to interact with axel-based objects like valves.<br />
							The existing method for hinged objects couldn't be used, because hinged objects rely on a vector indicating the "forward" direction that a door or lever is facing in.</p>
							
							<p>Hence, I had to make a method that considers the player's mouse movement relative to the point on the wheel by which they are holding it.<br />
							This involved creating a vector perpendicular to the axis of rotation, between it and the point-of-holding. From this and the axis of rotation, a vector perpendicular to both can be created.<br />
							This gives a vector that is tangential to the circle and perpendicular to the axis of rotation, against which to compare the player input.</p>
							
<pre>
<code class="cpp-html">
const FVector& InteractorRightVector = PlayerInteractor->GetRightVector();
const FVector& InteractorUpVector = PlayerInteractor->GetUpVector();
const FVector& ForwardVector = GetOwner()->GetActorForwardVector();
const FVector& RightVector = GetOwner()->GetActorRightVector();
const FVector& UpVector = GetOwner()->GetActorUpVector();
const FVector& ActorLocation = GetOwner()->GetActorLocation();

const FVector InputVector = ( InVector.X * InteractorRightVector ) - ( InVector.Y * InteractorUpVector );

const FVector HandPosition = PlayerInteractor->CursorWorldPosition;

// Closest point on valve axis to hand position
const FVector NearestPointOnForward = ActorLocation + ( ForwardVector * FVector::DotProduct( (HandPosition - ActorLocation), ForwardVector ) );
// Vector between these points
const FVector AxisToHand = HandPosition - NearestPointOnForward;
// Tangent to circular path around valve
const FVector Tangent = -FVector::CrossProduct(ForwardVector, AxisToHand);

const float Scalar = (CursorMode) ? DragCursorMultiplier : DragMouseMultiplier;

const float InputAlignment = FVector::DotProduct(InputVector, Tangent) * MovementScale * Scalar;

Momentum = FMath::Clamp(Momentum + InputAlignment, -MaxMomentum, MaxMomentum);
</code>
</pre>
							
							<p>This has worked well, creating a wheel that will respond accurately to input based on the position of the wheel this force is applied from.<br />
							Other factors like the number of possible rotations are all parameterised for ease-of-use.</p>
							
							
							<h2 id="page-anchor">3D-Interactive Books:</h2>
							
							<iframe width="1200" height="680"
								
								  <source src="images/InteractiveBookDemo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								
							</iframe>
							<p></p>
							
							<p>As a gameplay demo based around terminal usage developed, I needed to make an interactive manual.<br />
							The first step was creating an interaction component for interpolating objects like books between the table and a raised position.</p>
							
							<p>The first manual iteration changed pages through arrow key usage, which was functional but unsuitable as these keys were to be used by the terminal.<br />
							Hence, a second version was developed with 3D, physically turned pages using the interaction system, these pages were also capable of pushing each other.</p>
							
							<p>This has proven suitable, and allows for more immersive interaction whilst freeing keys for use by the terminal</p>
							
							
							<h2 id="plank-anchor">Improved Object Carrying:</h2>
							
							<iframe width="518" height="330"
								src="images/planks.gif">
							</iframe>
							
							<p>I revisited and improved the carrying system, starting with parametrization of the carry component.<br />
							This was done so that each object could have its own values for features like the carrying position, or offset from a surface when held against it.</p>
							
							<p>Most of the carrying logic was then moved into the component itself, so that I could add more functionality to held objects.<br />
							The first test of this is the planks shown above, which must be held onto to remove them from the wall, before they can be set aside.<br />
							I also used these to test a dithered fade effect that runs before the object is removed, to help reduce scene clutter.</p>
							
							<h2 id="double-anchor">Dual-Object Carrying Changes:</h2>
							
							<p>The ability to hold only one carryable object at a time was originally a design choice, to encourage the player to carefully choose what to bring with them.<br />
							In hindsight, this created inconvenient situations, such as replacing a fuse for a fusebox involving juggling items between the players hand and the floor.</p>
							
							<p>Hence, a second physics handle was added, and I changed the carrying logic to allow an object to be stored "offhand".<br />
							All dragging logic would be unaffected by the offhand carrying of an object.</p>
							
							<p>This proved to be a suitable design change, removing a frustrating element of gameplay.</p>
							
							<h2 id="overlay-anchor">Object Placement Improvements:</h2>
							
							<iframe width="723" height="463"
								src="images/newvalve.gif">
							</iframe>
							
							<p>As I put the new features through testing, issues were found with communicating to a player where objects can or should be placed, and how to do so.<br />
							Where some objects were naturally intuitive to some players, others were less familiar, so more visual indicators were needed.</p>
							
							<p>The solution to this came in two parts;</p>
							
							<p>Firstly, when a carryable object was held, a highlight effect would be applied to all suitable objects it could be placed into.<br />
							This effect faded with distance as to not illuminate objects across the entire map, and generally solved the issues of identifying where objects should go.</p>
							
							<p>Secondly, when an object overlaps the collision box of a suitable receptacle, an overlay effect is applied to indicate that it is safe to let go of the object.<br />
							This was required because of some players frequently letting go of an object too far away, dropping it on the floor and needing to step back and retrieve it.</p>
							
							<p>These changes have drastically improved player understanding of the mechanics in a visually pleasant way, whilst avoiding more direct text-explanations.</p>
